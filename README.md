# landing-page
Creating Landing page based on given layout/image of The Odin Project Foundations Course

Postmortem: (can't think of another term)
Not sure if I did it correctly. Feel like there's way too much "nesting" (is that a term?)
Had to draw wireframes on paper to "get" what was going to happen on the page.
Like which container contained which div and such.
Not responsive, but I might come back at a later date to do it.
